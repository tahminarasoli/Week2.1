## I just added this new repo to practice prep materials for sunday's class
I will do some practice with below listed items:
 -[X] clone trough command line.
 -[X] bring some changes in the file.
 -[X] commit changes to online version in github.
 -[ ] work with branching.
 -[ ] pull request. 

and this is the first changes i have made ;) lets see what happens.
